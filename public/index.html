				<p>I am a student at Grand Valley State University, working towards a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with an expected graduation date in April 2015. I have a previous degree in Art and Design also from Grand Valley State University.</p>
				<p>My computer science education has given me the basic knowledge of programming languages, databases, computer architecture, software engineering/development, and usability development. All of these have taught me how to write programs, structure information, test code and debug it. I have the tools needed for many software engineering positions. Having the tools and knowing how to use them works well when you are given detailed specs, walking through the project. I also have a previous degree in Art and Design. While working on this first degree, I learned creative problem solving, abstract thinking, independent research practices, inception to completion project management, constructive criticism in addition to the principles of design, gestalt theories and color theories. These are the skills that allow me to come to a project or problem and work through it creatively to find the best solution, not just the first or easiest one.</p>

			<p>Aside from all the general work and study information, I would like to add a little more about my personal/family life that often is left out of resumes and interviews.<p>
 
			<p>I have been married for 9 years to a lady I met while getting my Art and Design Degree. She is an artist who is currently working with woodcut prints. We have two kids: Corben, my son who is 3 years old and Trillium, my daughter who is 1 1/2 years old. They are both wonderful and difficult (as any parent would say). It was the birth of my son that inspired me to return to school. My family is the driving force behind how hard I work on my education. I know that the better I do the better their lives will become.</p>

			<p>Personally I have two passions: technology and craft. One of my earliest memories is playing on a Mac Classic, playing games and drawing with MacPaint. When Toy Story came out I became fascinated with computer animation and would build things with a program called Infini-D. Then one event change my life (at that point at least), I saw a picture of Fallingwater. This is a home designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. I then wanted to be an architect. It was in high school, though, that I started to be more interested in art and decided to go to Grand Valley for Art and Design. Even though I never became an architect, his style and drive for craftsmanship has influenced me. This was the reason I made furniture in art school. It is the reason I try so hard to make the code I write now look aesthetically pleasing. This sense of craft is something I really strive to achieve.</p>

				<h5>Why would you go back to school after getting an Art and Design degree?</h5>
				<p>The reason I am going back to get a CS degree is a little personal. The short answer is that I like art and computers and want to work in both.</p>
				 <p>The long answer is that some people are more like their mother, some like their father. I got stuck being like both my parents. My mother is an art teacher and my dad was part owner of local Apple Computer seller until about 15 years ago when he started his own accounting practice. I thought I was like my mother so I pursued art at Grand Valley and while there I realized I wasn't that interested in the real thick conceptual art and ended up making furniture as sculpture.</p>
				 <p>I got the degree and worked at a flooring company. Working with an interior designer, she would come up with the designs for her clients and I would have to try to give her a price for labor and material. At times, I would have to work with her to find a way to make some of her crazier ideas a reality. I would sometimes get to make pieces of furniture for her clients on the side. Most of my time there I was in front of a computer working out numbers on a spreadsheet. I would try to find ways to make my job easier by making the spreadsheet be more efficient  or find other programs to make it so I had to do less work. I liked working on these shortcuts more then the rest of my job. It was the furniture, computer shortcuts, and the understanding that I am a lot more like my dad after all that got me interested in Computer Science and trying to make other peoples' jobs easier with computers.</p>
				 <p>My interests in school now, and in the job pursuit afterwards, would ideally combine both design and computer programming, though more heavily on the programming side. I like the whole software development process, from inception to completion. And all the challenges in-between.</p>
        	</div>

				<h5>Has there been any way you have applied your Art and Design degree in your software development?</h5>
				<p>I can say I have applied my art education in all my projects. One of the key things I learned from that degree is problem solving. Early art school projects start out with a set of requirements. Usually a material requirement like wood, metal or cast bronze. Then a topic requirement, like exploring the idea of "consumption" or "beauty/repulsion dichotomy." Then we have to come of with our idea, discuss it with the professor. And then figure out how we are going to build it. This ideation phase was helpful in software design because we were taught to map things out as much ahead of time as possible. And to work an idea past the initial "so obvious it is bad" ideas and into the better more thought out ideas. The purpose of the material requirement is to teach us some process like woodworking, welding or mold making and casting. When learning these processes we inevitably ran into some big problems. It was learning how to solve the problem by either making models, practicing the process or reworking our idea to best fit the changes that was very helpful in my software development.</p>
				<p>By the end of art education I was very interested in craft. I was making wood furniture, and was always trying to come up with projects that pushed my skills to be a better craftsman. It is this interest in craft that pushes me even now when working on projects. And just like with my woodworking projects when I finish a software project I am aware of all the flaws and well after the completion I think of how I could improve it.</p>
				 <p>There is also my interest in making my project look a good as I can. This comes from the design side of my art degree. Which is leading me to take a graphic design class in January.</p>

				<h5>Describe a project you worked on recently. What are the things that went well, went bad and what would do differently?</h5>
				<p>As a student a recent project I have completed is a term project for my Usability Design and Evaluation class. The assignment was to create the user interface for a hypothetical website or product. We developed the interface by going though contextual analysis, ideation, prototyping and usability testing. This was a group project and I usually learn a lot when working with a group.</p>
				<p>The product our group chose was to make the user interface for a hypothetical smart watch called The Dial. In the last few months there has been a lot of buzz about the smart watch idea and we wanted to see what ideas our group could come up with in this new arena. One of the first things we did wrong was right here at the beginning. We decided to develop the smart watch's OS interface and work on developing many of the standard apps that would be used by the users. This was, with hindsight, a grand task. I have to interject here and say that taking a project and making it bigger then the assignment requires is a tendency I have developed since I started back to school. Every chance I have I want to learn more, push my skills, and make a finished product. For this project my ideas overreached the requirements. I wanted this project to be a full and complete interface from lock screen to full applications. I blame this one on iOS 7 and wanting to try my hand at OS design.</p>
				<p>There are two major things that I felt went well in this project: the quality of the finished product and the impact on me and my education. Though the project was grand in scope, the final product, being a rough draft of sorts, turned out greater because of the process. Being able to develop ideas with others, test the product and iterate the design allowed the project to develop a richer user experience then I could have done on my own. Even though it is a rough draft I can see the potential of where, with more testing and iteration, it could become the kind of interface I appreciate in other products. I see how this process is very beneficial and even necessary in developing real applications. It is this experience of seeing the process that has taught me a lot. Mainly, it is all the little mistakes along the way that give me the hindsight of how it should have been done. I equate this experience like trying to ice skate for the first time. Our group fell a lot during the process because we have never developed a project in such a formal way. Small things were learned like when preparing for a test, run through it with someone unfamiliar with the project before the formal tests. Also, forcing myself to slow down and concentrate on the step in the process we are on and not thinking ahead. I wanted to start designing during contextual analysis, or add more polish in the wireframes. I kept wanting to work on the final product as I worked through the steps. Patience is not just about delayed gratification it is about waiting till you fully understand all you need to know in order to do the best work when you get to the next step. These are just a few of the "lessons" I learned in this process in addition to the intended lessons the professor expected.</p>
				<p>In addition to taking on a grand project, the other thing I feel went wrong is the intensity of the group. I am a returning student and that gives me a perspective different then most the other students. I know I am taking my education a lot more seriously then I did when I got my first degree. In many ways this sets me apart from the other students I worked with in this group. I also have a greater interest in the process of usability design and testing then the other students in the group. There was one co-worker that had less of an interest then I did for the project. This created a gap when working and advancing the project. The one main example of this gap was with the project reports. Through out the semester we had to turn in reports describing the process we were taking in developing the smart watch interface. In the end we had a roughly 50 page report detailing the entire process from contextual analysis to final conclusion and design evaluation. The professor expected business level quality in the reports. To me this meant full color, formatted reports printed on quality paper. Something you can be proud of. The other student felt a simple black and white print would suffice and did not help pay for the quality prints I had done. With every report we turned in the professor commented on the quality of the project. To me this meant that the level of quality in the reports was a reflection of the quality of the project. Having this division on how we both saw the process was a barrier that could be bridged with a good project leader. I felt, by the end,  the gap did not deter me from trying has hard as I could on the project. This type of situation or others like it in group work will come up in any project and being able to talk about it and work around it is a skill I am always trying to work on.</p>
				<p>I have detailed some of the things I might have done differently on this project above, but the one thing I would have loved to be able to do is keep working on it. This class and this term project has changed the way I want to think about any project I am working on. Taking the time to work through the steps: concentrating on researching the users' needs and requirements, developing the ideas and processes the project will need, and creation of a product that works for the user. I want to, with all my projects, create the best experience while getting the needed work done. I will take the lessons learned in this class and on this project to all my other course work and any project I work for an employer.</p>

          <p>Well working at my internship I was inspired by a co-worker that uses emacs to build a plug in to help with my development tasks. The project at the internship is a Ruby on Rails application with javascript MVP patterns. It lends itself to a well organized file naming structure. The plug-in takes the name of the file you are working on and finds similar files based on user defined settings. You can see it on my <a href="https://github.com/Bwata/framily-plan">github page</a> and I hope to add it to the package controller soon.</p>

					<h3>theDial<h3>
					<h6>CIS 368: Usability Design and Evaluation</h6>
					<h6>Fall 2013</h6>
					
					<p>The assignment was to create the user interface for a hypothetical website or product. The product our group chose was to make the user interface for a hypothetical smart watch called The Dial. We developed the interface by going though contextual analysis, ideation, prototyping and usability testing. The semester long project concluded with a high fidelity prototype used for usability testing and a report detailing the process we went through. I developed the prototype with HTML, CSS and Javascript. It is specifically designed for use on an iPad. But if you enable touch controls on chrome you can use it there. You can check it out <a href="http://www.bwata.com/thedial">here</a>. You can also see the final report <a href="resources/theDialReport.pdf">pdf here</a>.</p>

					<h3>bwata.com<h3>
					<h6>Personal Project</h6>
					<h6>Fall 2013</h6>
					
					<p>This <a href="http://www.bwata.com/">website</a> is a way of displaying the woodcut prints my wife makes. The design has changed many times in the last year and it is kind of the testing ground for things I want to try and things I want to learn. Though you can't see how it was, I have decided to simplify it since it started for design reasons. I am hoping to really apply what I learn in my web applications class to the site.</p>

					<h3>Programming Language Assignments<h3>
					<h6>CIS 343: Structure Programming Language</h6>
					<h6>Fall 2013</h6>
					
					<p>For my programming languages class we did a few small projects to learn the basics of three different languages and then we had a final pair project where we picked a language we have not worked with and research the aspects of the language and recreate one of the other projects in that language. These are not very complicated assignments. The three languages are C, Ruby and Lisp. The pair project language we chose was Objective-C. You can see the <a href="https://github.com/Bwata/Prog-Lang-Assignments">assignments and code</a> at my Github page.</p>

					<h3>Tweet9001<h3>
					<h6>CIS 350: Intro Software Engineering</h6>
					<h6>Winter 2013</h6>
					
					<p>This semester long assignment was to develop a twitter client using the Twitter4J api. The purpose of the assignment was to learn about the software development process from UML design, development, metrics testing, and multiple releases. We also learned eclipse plugins, version control and I personally learned how to manipulate java's swing look and feel. <a href="resources/Tweet9001Report.pdf">Here</a> is a version of the third and final release report of the project. And the <a href="https://github.com/Bwata/Tweet9001">source code on github</a> for you to look at.</p>

					<h3>VI-sualizer<h3>
					<h6>CIS 163: Computer Science II</h6>
					<h6>Fall 2012</h6>
					
					<p>This assignment is designed to teach us how to use linked-lists. It is a VI style text editor (sort of). It wasn't that interesting but then again VI isn't either. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/Bwata/VI-sualizer">source code on github</a> for you to look at.</p>

					<h3>GOEntertainment<h3>
					<h6>CIS 163: Computer Science II</h6>
					<h6>Fall 2012</h6>
					
					<p>This is a group project that taught me a lot of lessons I am still working on even now. The purpose of the assignment was a simple one about learning polymorphism, swing components, serialization, saving/loading from a text file and using the date class. We were to learn this by creating a simple Redbox style DVD checkout system. I wanted to do more. So I convince my group to go all out and create a full on system with user accounts, an admin section, DVD inventory, and we wanted to pull the information from IMDB. Well this was a lot for 4 beginners to attempt in about 5 weeks. We got done but with too many late or all nighters, some arguments within the group and final product that is awkward, buggy and missing a lot of documentation. The main lesson I learned was about moderation. Don't take on more then you know you can do. I still tend to attempt too much in my assignments. I also learned a lot about how to work in a group. If you want to try to read this beast you can see the <a href="https://github.com/Bwata/GOEntertainment">source code on github</a> if you want.</p>
